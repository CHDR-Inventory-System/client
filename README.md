# CHDR Inventory System - Client

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) installed.

**Because of a few conflicting webpack dependencies, you'll need to have node version >=16.0.0**

Once you've cloned the repository, run `yarn` to install dependencies and `yarn dev` to run the site on localhost.
